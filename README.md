# Ridge and Lasso Regression
Before get into Ridge and Lasso regression/regularization, Let's know about Regularization

# Regularization
This is a sort of regression, that constrains/regularizes or shrinks the coefficient estimates towards zero. In other words, this system discourages learning a more complex or flexible model, so on avoid the danger of overfitting.
There are two types of Regularizations
1. Ridge regularization
2. Lasso regularization

Here, I deployed a web application called <a href='https://ml-regularization.herokuapp.com/'>ml-regularization</a> which is used to perform regularization and finds best regularization using machine learning.
